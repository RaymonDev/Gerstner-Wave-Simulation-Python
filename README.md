# Gerstner-Wave-Simulation-Python

## Description
This repository, "Gerstner-Wave-Simulation-Python", contains a Python script that simulates a Gerstner wave using matplotlib and numpy. The wave parameters such as wavenumber, angular frequency, phase, and amplitude can be adjusted in the code to visualize different wave behaviors.

## Contents
- `wave_simulation.py`: This is the main Python script that generates the wave simulation.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries: numpy, matplotlib.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
